            <h3>Thank you for visiting Singibook website</h3>
            <p class="wrapper-description">

                Singibook is the leading travel metasearch company in Eastern Europe and Central Asia — allowing users to search for air tickets, hotel accommodation and car rental.
                In 2021 the company achieved a gross merchandise value (GMV) of <span>over $1.6bn</span>. 
                During 2021 the company attracted a series B investment round worth $43m from iTech Capital and Elbrus Capital. 
                Since it was founded in 2007 the company now employs around 500 staff in its main office in Thailand and worldwide remotely.
                In addition to its main Singibook brand, the company also has a B2B travel technology offering including Travelpayouts (a partnership platform) and Aviastats (revenue optimisation data for airlines). <br> <br>
                One of Singibook's <span>strategic goals</span> is the continuous modernization of aircraft, control systems and technical support, together with the continuous improvement of our crew.    
                To provide our passengers with even greater comfort, whatever their flight class, we strengthened our fleet with eight new aircraft in 2022.
                Another Airbus A330-200 was added to our fleet for long-haul traffic, bearing the image of the famous scientist and inventor of Serbian origin Mihajlo Pupin.
                The turbojet fleet was strengthened with Airbus A319 and A320 aircraft, while the regional fleet was rejuvenated with ATR 72-600s. <br><br>
                The Singibook mobile application for iOS was launched in May 2012. The company released a version for Android in the following year. In 2013, the service introduced an interactive map that helps users search for the cheapest flights. In <span>July 2016</span>, Singibook launched a chatbot for messengers such as Slack, Facebook, Viber, and Telegram. The chatbot allows users to choose departure and destination cities, as well as the month and duration of the trip, and updates users when ticket prices increase or decrease. <br><br>
                Singibook introduced baggage selection in its search results in 2017, claiming to be the first company to offer this feature. Baggage policies are highlighted for each individual airfare, and users can search for and select fares with or without checked baggage. In 2020, the company launched “Singibook for business”, a service that helps enterprise clients with last minute changes, cancellations, and paperwork related to business trips.
                In 2021, the Singibook Plus service was launched, providing cashback for travel services, exclusive travel content, and premium support. The same year, Singibook launched “Where you can go”, a guide to re-opened countries. “Where you can go” contains information about COVID-19 restrictions and conditions for traveling.
